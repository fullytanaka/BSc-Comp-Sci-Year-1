# Aaron's BSc Computer Science Year 1 
You can find all my notes/projects for computer science here. This is just a way for me to backup all my notes somewhere.

## Prerequisites
- Libre Office suite, so to access these files you need to have this installed.
- BlueJ is the IDE that I am using for Java. I might switch to IntelliJ at some point.
- Xournal is the program I use to do hand annotation with my Graphics Tablet.

## Contacting me
You can find me on the Fresher's Discord server. Check the material pinned in the WhatsApp group chat, or add me directly. (Tanakasaki#0999)
