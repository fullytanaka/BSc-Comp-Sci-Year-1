You can find all my notes/projects for computer science here. This is just a way for me to backup all my notes somewhere.

## Prerequisites
- Libre Office suite to access the doc files.
- BlueJ is the IDE that I am using for learning Java. I might switch to IntelliJ at some point.
- Xournal is the program I use to do hand annotation with my Graphics Tablet.
